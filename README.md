# Fixed-Point-vs-Floating-point
## A Report Presented for the lab assignment on Comparison of Matrix multiplication using floating-point and fixed-point representation.

### Following task has been performed
• Made a project structure with following folders
o Include
o Lib
o Src
o Obj
• Constructed a ‘make’ file
• Implemented fixed point and floating-point matric multiplication
o Varied the size of matrix in each iteration
o In each iteration matrices were initialized with random floating point numbers.
o Time taken for each matrix multiplication was calculated for floating point and fixed point implementation.
• Following values have been written into a file for each iteration
o Log of Size of the matrix
o Time taken for Floating point Multiplication
o Time taken for Fixed point Multiplication
• A graph had been plotted using gnu plot
• Everything has been implemented such that if you type ‘make’ in the terminal window, the required graph will be generated.
• Finally, a graph has been plotted in MATLAB to compare with C program implementation
• Maximum size of the square matrix has been limited to 1000 because of high compilation time.
